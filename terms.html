          <h2>4. User Content and Data</h2>

          <h3>4.1 Ownership of Your Content</h3>
          <p>
            You retain all ownership rights to the content you create, store, or
            manage in NoteNest, including:

          </ul>

          <h3>4.2 License to Use Your Content</h3>
          <p>
            By using NoteNest, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive,
            royalty-free license to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Store your content on your device using encrypted local storage
            </li>
            <li>
              Process your content to provide App functionality (search,
              categorization, reminders)
            </li>
            <li>
              Back up your content to Google Drive (only if you explicitly
              enable cloud backup)
            </li>
            <li>
              Transmit your content as necessary to provide Services (e.g.,
              Firebase Authentication)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT access, read, analyze, or use
            your note content for any purpose other than providing the Service.
            Your notes remain private and are stored locally on your device
            using encrypted storage.
          </p>

          <h3>4.3 Data Storage and Security</h3>
          <p>NoteNest uses a "local-first" approach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your data is stored locally on
              your Android device using encrypted Room Database and
              EncryptedSharedPreferences
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloud Backup (Optional):</strong> You may choose to back
              up your encrypted database to your personal Google Drive. We do
              not have access to your Google Drive data
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Firebase Services:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication
              for secure login, Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting, and
              Firebase Analytics for aggregated usage statistics (no personal
              content is shared)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4.4 Backup Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            While NoteNest provides local and cloud backup features, you are
            solely responsible for maintaining backups of your important data.
            We are not liable for any data loss, corruption, or deletion that
            may occur due to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Device malfunction, loss, or theft</li>
            <li>App uninstallation or data clearing</li>
            <li>Operating system updates or factory resets</li>
            <li>User error or accidental deletion</li>
            <li>Technical failures beyond our control</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We strongly recommend regularly creating backups using our backup
            features.
          </p>
